# Movie Ratings: IMDB vs Rotten Tomatoes vs Metacritic vs Fandango

### Summary:

* Fandango ratings are very unlikely to be in the bottom 60% of their 5-star scale. They also have a median and quartiles that are higher than those of their peers. This evidence support FiveThirtyEight's assertion to be wary of their ratings.
* But also be wary of IMDB ratings, which are rarely in the bottom 40% of their 10-point scale. They also have a relatively narrow IQR/spread.
* Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings span most of the 100-point scales
* Rotten Tomatoes has the most uniform distribution of ratings.
